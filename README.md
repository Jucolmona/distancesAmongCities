# distancesAmongCities
This repository contains source code of a personal and academic project, which find out the shortest path among two cities of Colombian.

The first Version of this project began as a college work, which the fundamental goal is implement the functional programing paradigm. In this case I created a GUI program with  PyQT library for its graphic interface, and for implementation of the shortest patch among cities of Colombian, I use the Networx library. Both, PyQT and Networkx are python library.
